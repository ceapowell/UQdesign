# UQdesign
Reading list for the Design working group at the INI UQ programme

Key(?) papers, in an approximate suggested reading order (within each category). All papers are available electronically via the links below courtesy of the Cambridge library. If any programme participants have trouble accessing any papers, let me (DCW) know.
